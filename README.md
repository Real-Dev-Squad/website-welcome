Scripts Used in the Project
We have provided some useful scripts for project development:

npm run check: Checks the formatting of all files in the project. This script runs automatically in a pre-commit hook to warn about improper formatting.

npm run fix: Can be run to fix formatting issues before committing your changes or to resolve formatting errors that may occur during commits. Make sure to run this script before committing to ensure that GitHub checks pass.

Troubleshooting CORS Errors
If you encounter CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors for API calls during development, please refer to our documentation for guidance on resolving these issues.
